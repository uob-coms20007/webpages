## Haskell

  * [Thompson's *Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming*](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/741807421).  There are lots of good beginner's textbooks on functional programming in Haskell, this is one of them.  Perhaps also revisit your notes from COMS10016.

  * [Stephen Diehl's *What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell*](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/). If you are happy with the basics of defining functions, then this is a well-regarded resource that covers lots of the Haskell ecosystem and how to develop Haskell in practice.

## Transition Systems

  * [Aarhus *Algorithms and Data Structures Notes*](https://cs.au.dk/~gerth/dADS1-12/daimi-fn64.pdf). Chapter 1 is useful additional reading about transition systems.  The notation is a bit different but should be easy to follow.  There are more examples.

## Automata and Regular Languages

  * [Sipser's *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/1100692691). We will cover some of the material of Chapter 1 in Weeks 2, 3 and 4.  Note that Sipser's definition of how an automaton computes is different, but equivalent to ours (he effectively inlines our definition in terms of traces).  Some of the problem sheet exercies are drawn from this book, which contains many more.

  * [Kozen's *Automata and Computability*](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/959147733). Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 have a lot of overlap with what we will cover.  Some of the problem sheet exercises are drawn from this book, which has many others.

  * [Appel's *Modern Compiler Implementation in ML*](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/985378534). There are also versions of this book "... in Java" and "... in C" for those who like to hurt themselves.  This covers the connection of automata and regular expressions with compilers quite well.
