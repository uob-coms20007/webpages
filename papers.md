## Assessment

The unit is 100% assessed by a written exam in the January exam period.

This exam is considered open book in the following sense:
*Candidates may bring to the exam room 1 double-sided A4 page of notes in any format.*

In addition, almost all of the important definitions from the unit are available for your reference at the back of the exam paper.  A practice paper is available below so that you can familiarise yourself with the format.

The exam is a series of problems to solve in the same style as the weekly problem sheets.  There will be questions covering material from all parts of the unit.  The difficulty of questions is related to your possible marks in the following way:

* 1* questions only account for approximately 40% of available marks.
* 1* and 2* questions account for approximately 70% of available marks.
* 1\*, 2\* and 3* questions account for approximately 100% of available marks.

Unfortunately, this is not quite true for the practice paper linked above, because we had to assemble it from a number of sources due to changes in the material taught this year.  Partial marks are given for partially correct answers.  This is important, because you are unlikely to answer all the 3* question(s) completely correctly in the given time, but it is possible to obtain some marks for an attempt.

The distribution of marks by topic is as follows:
* 40 marks are available for questions on regular expressions, automata and regular languages.
* 30 marks are available for questions on the syntax and semantics of the While language.
* 30 marks are available for questions on computability.

However, *you should make sure you are confident on all topics* because the exam will contain 1*, 2* and 3* questions within each of these topics.

Typical examples of the shape of 1* questions (mostly mechanical tasks that require careful use of definitions but very little insight):
* Recall some simple facts about the definitions we have studied, such as the meaning of accepting state, decidable, abstract syntax tree, and so on.
* Carry out some (mostly) mechanical procedure, e.g. drawing an abstract syntax tree, checking if some given syntax is valid, giving examples of strings matched by a regex, giving a derivation for a regex matching a string.
* Writing a While program to achieve some simple specification.
* Describing what a While program computes/what language a regex recognises.
* Deducing the final state after executing a While program from a given starting configuration.

Typical examples of the shape of 2* questions (mostly constructing simple objects -- programs, equational proofs, derivations, automata etc -- to meet given requirements):
* Construct a regex/automaton to recognise a given language/show that a language is regular.
* Writing a While program to achieve some more complex specification.
* Use the pumping lemma to show that a language is not regular.
* Construct a derivation for a given program in the While semantics.
* Prove simple properties of functions/combinations of functions (injectivity, surjectivity etc).
* Show that a predicate is decidable/semi-decidable.

Some typical examples of the shape of 3* questions, but 3* questions are often atypical and of a shape that you may have never encountered before during the unit.
* Show that a predicate is undecidable.
* Show that regular languages are closed under a given operation.
* Show that a language is regular, where there is some insight needed to first simplify the description of the language.
* Prove, using an invariant/variant that a While program satisfies a given property.

*Before the day of the exam, you should be confident in your ability to answer typical 1\* and 2\* questions.*

General feedback sent to students on the overall performance in last years exam can be viewed [here](feedback.txt).  Note, the question numbers do not correspond directly to those in the practice paper (linked above) because the practice paper is not exactly the same as last year's exam, due to changes in the material taught for this year.

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>

The practice exam is loosely based on last year's January exam, but modified because there are differences between the material taught last year and material taught this year.  One consequence of this is that new material for this year is not well covered by the practice exam or miscellaneous exam problems below, this includes:

* Abstract syntax trees and grammars
* Big-step semantics for Regex
* Big-step semantics for While programs (was only briefly covered previously)
