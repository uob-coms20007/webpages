<h2>Practice Problems</h2>

Make sure you have read all the information from the Assessment section at the bottom of the homepage.

The practice exam is loosely based on last year's January exam, but modified because there are differences between the material taught last year and material taught this year.  One consequence of this is that new material for this year is not well covered by the practice exam or miscellaneous exam problems below, this includes:

* Abstract syntax trees and grammars
* Big-step semantics for Regex
* Big-step semantics for While programs (was only briefly covered previously)
