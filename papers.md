<h2>Practice Paper</h2>
<p>
This practice paper is an adaptation of the exam from last year to suit the new material in the unit.  Due to differences between this and last years material, some questions on this practice paper are more difficult than questions on the real exam.  For example, the encoding of tuples of natural numbers as words over an alphabet of bitvectors, seen here in practice exam Question 1(c), was a feature of several lectures last year, but it only occurs as a small part of one optional problem sheet question this year.
