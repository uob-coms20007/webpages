  theme: Nondeterminism
  description: We introduce non-determinism and internal actions to our automata.  We show that, from every non-deterministic automaton we can obtain an equivalent deterministic automaton and thus deduce that there is no increase in expressive power.

  description: We introduce the class of regular languages as those that are recognisable by finite automata.  We show that this class is closed under various operations on languages but that it is ultimately limited - there are languages that are not regular.

  description: To understand the fundamental limitations of computation, we consider the case of decision problems, and we argue that it suffices to consider decision problems on natural numbers.  A problem is said to be decidable whenever we can describe an algorithm to solve it.
