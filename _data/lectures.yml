- title: Introduction
  description: Introduction to the themes of the unit and how the unit runs.  Strings, concrete syntax and a preview of context-free string grammars.

  description: Context-free grammars as a device for representing a language.  Motivation for abstract syntax trees.

- title: Abstract Syntax
  description: In this first Monday Q&A, rather than take questions, we continued covering material needed for the labs.  Abstract syntax trees, tree grammars and how to write trees as inline expressions - precedence and association as conventions for omitting parens.

- title: Regex Syntax
  description: We defined the abstract syntax of regular expressions and discussed the meaning informally.

- title: Regex Semantics
  description: The big step operational semantics of regular expressions, i.e. the relation "matches".  Rules, instantiation of rules and glueing instances of rules together to make a proof tree or derivation.

- title: Q&A 1
  description: We talked about how you should think about matching regular expressions and strings, we went through some of the examples from the lectures again in more detail and we discussed what you should do when your proof trees get too large.

- title: Kleene's Theorem
  description: We looked at an example of an automaton for computing the addition of two numbers (really for recognising the graph of the addition function).  We considered Kleene's Theorem, and I sketched the algorithms that compute a regex from a DFA and vice versa.

- title: Q&A 2
  description: We talked about how to go about answering tricky regex construction questions, including if there is a mechanical process that one can follow.  We also looked in more detail at an example automaton construction problem that I started in the lectures.

- title: Matched Parens not Regular
  description: We gave a name to the class of languages that one can express using regex (which is the same as the class that one can express using DFA), called Regular.  We proved that the language of matched parentheses is not regular.

- title: Pumping Lemma
  description: The pumping lemma was introduced, I argued why it is true and then gave an example of how to use it.  Unfortunately, despite by best efforts at the start of the lecture, I was not able to coax the Replay system into filming both boards.  So the left board is not visible, but all it contained was a statement of the pumping lemma, and that is available in the reference material.

- title: Syntax and Semantics of Expressions
  description: We discussed a new language, and briefly justified the study of its syntax and semantics. We then started defining those, bottom-up, relying on the concepts of abstract syntax trees, tree grammars and derivations introduced much earlier by Steven.

- title: Syntax and Semantics of While Statements
  description: We carried on developing the syntax and semantics of the While language, making a stopover to discuss a neat way of defining inductive relations when they are in fact functional.
