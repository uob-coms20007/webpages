- title: Introduction
  description: Themes of the unit, how the unit runs.  We also talked about strings, but we will recap that in the next lecture.  Unfortunately, the *Replay* system did not work, so there is no recording of this lecture.

- title: Regex Syntax
  description: Some notation and nomenclature to do with strings/words, and then we introduced the syntax of regular expressions.  The replay recording only shows the projector screen, but I frequently write on the boards, so I suggest you use the notes to follow along.
