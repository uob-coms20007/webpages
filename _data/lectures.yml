- title: Introduction
  description: Themes of the unit, how the unit runs.  We also talked about strings, but we will recap that in the next lecture.  Unfortunately, the *Replay* system did not work, so there is no recording of this lecture.

- title: Regex Syntax
  description: Some notation and nomenclature to do with strings/words, and then we introduced the syntax of regular expressions.  The replay recording only shows the projector screen, but I frequently write on the boards, so I suggest you use the notes to follow along.

  description: Some syntactic sugar to making writing regex sweeter.  Operational semantics for regular expressions, configurations and transitions, traces.

- title: Kleene's Theorem
  description: The statement of Kleene's Theorem and how to understand its meaning.  The formal construction of an automaton from a given regular expression and an illustration of the opposite direction.

- title: Inexpressibility
  description: The inexpressibility of a language of matched "parentheses" done somewhat informally.  The observation that, if a finite automaton accepts a very long string, it must go through a loop.

- title: Regularity
  description: The languages expressible by regular expressions (= the language expressible by finite automata) are called regular.  We converted our informal observation about long strings accepted by short automata into a mathematical property of regular languages, called the pumping lemma.

- title: Determinisation
  description: We look at a particular kind of finite automata, which are called deterministic, and observe they have several nice properties.  We observe that non-determinism is nevertheless useful as a programming/design abstraction and that non-determinism can be "compiled away" by exploring all non-deterministic choices in parallel.

- title: The While Language and its Expressions
  description: We graduate from regular expressions to a simple imperative language. We discuss arithmetic expressions and their semantics.

- title: The While Language and its Statements
  description: We now define the syntax and operational semantics of the While language. We'll first step through semantics for boolean expressions before defining the semantics of programmes.
