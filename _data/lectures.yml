- title: Abstract Syntax
  description: In this first Monday Q&A, rather than take questions, we continued covering material needed for the labs.  Abstract syntax trees, tree grammars and how to write trees as inline expressions - precedence and association as conventions for omitting parens.

- title: Regex Semantics
  description: The big step operational semantics of regular expressions, i.e. the relation "matches".  Rules, instantiation of rules and glueing instances of rules together to make a proof tree or derivation.

- title: Q&A 1
  description: We talked about how you should think about matching regular expressions and strings, we went through some of the examples from the lectures again in more detail and we discussed what you should do when your proof trees get too large.
