## Welcome

Welcome to the home of COMS20007: Programming Languages and Computation.  This unit introduces you programming language theory and to the theory of computation.  These are two closely connected, core areas of theoretical computer science.

* *Programming Language Theory* concerns the syntax, semantics and analysis of programming languages.
* The *Theory of Computation* concerns the fundamental limitations of computation as a means to solve algorithmic problems.

In our 20 credit unit, we will be looking at one slice through these two subjects, and our focus will be on *describing computational systems*: using automata and imperative programming languages; and *reasoning about them*: both about particular computations and about the computational systems themselves.  

This unit prepares you for courses in the programming languages theme in your third and fourth year, especially *COMS30040: Types and Lambda Calculus* and *COMSM0067: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages*, but it's primary purpose is to make you better at *thinking* about computer programs.

## Schedule

*See [detailed schedule](schedule.html) for a comprehensive week-by-week synopsis.*

You should expect to spend around *12 hours per week* working on this unit.  There are 5 main activities:

  * __Prerecorded lectures (3 hr).__ At the start of each week, two hours of recorded lectures will be posted on the unit website which you should watch in your own time.

  * __Labs (2 hr).__  Labs occur every Thursday 1pm-3pm.  Excepting Week 1, labs are run in the Bill Brown Suite of Queens Building, *if you are able, please bring a laptop, pen and paper*.

  * __Problem sheets (4 hr).__ You will only learn on this unit by completing the problem sheets.  There is one sheet released each week.  You will spend time working on the sheets in labs, but you will likely need much longer to complete them fully in your own time.

  * __Lecturer Q&A (1 hr).__ Each week there will be a one-hour Q&A with the lecturers, online on Teams, at noon on every Monday.  The Q&A in Week 1 will be used as an introduction to the unit.

  * __Reading/Revising (2 hr).__  You will often benefit from alternative explanations of the same concepts, which would not fit into the time available for lectures.  You will need to spend time revising and rethinking topics before you can solve the associated problems.

## Navigating the course

The unit is distributed over four locations:

* This [blackboard page][bb], which contains:
    - the [welcome page](welcome.html), listing administrative information about the unit
    - the [detailed schedule](schedule.html), which links to the videos, the problem sheets and their solutions
    - the [assessment point](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_247719_1&content_id=_5949098_1&mode=reset) where you will take your final exam

* The [reference book][rf]{: target="_blank" }, which contains a reference version of technical material introduced in the lectures: you will need to refer to this when completing the problems.  
  Note: you will still need to consult the lecture videos for examples and explanation.

* The [labcode repository][lc]{: target="_blank" } which contains the starter code for the Haskell-based problem sheets.

* The [COMS20007 Team](te){: target="_blank" }, where we host the lecturer Q&As, the online labs and the discussion board.
