## Schedule

This is a 20 credit unit, so you should expect to around 13 hours per week working on it.  There are 5 main activities:
* __Prerecorded lectures.__ At the start of each week, three prerecorded lectures will be posted on the unit website which you need to watch in your own time.
* __Online labs.__  Labs occur online every Wednesday 9am-11am and Friday 2pm-5pm, but will only be staffed by TAs for a subset of those hours, see [Labs](/labs.html)
* __Problems.__ You will only learn on this unit by completing the problem sheets and exercises.  There is one sheet released each week.
* __Lecturer Q&A.__ Each week there will be a one-hour Q&A with the lecturer, online at 1pm on every Tuesday.
* __Reading/Revising.__  You will often benefit from alternative explanations of the same concepts, which would not fit into the time available for lectures.  You will need to spend time revising and rethinking topics before you can solve the associated problems.
