## Welcome

Welcome to the home of COMS20007: Programming Languages and Computation.  

This 20cp unit introduces you to some of the fundamentals of programming languages.  We will look at two very simple programming languages: a domain specific language for string matching, called *Regular Expressions*, and a general purpose imperative programming language called *While*.  In each case, we will study their:
  * *Syntax and semantics:* how to describe the programming language mathematically.
  * *Expressive power:* how to understand the limitations of the programming language by proving theorems.

This unit gives you a taster of several important topics in theoretical computer science: [Programming Language Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory), [Automata Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [Computability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory). It prepares you for courses in the programming languages theme in your third and fourth year, especially *COMS30040: Types and Lambda Calculus* and *COMSM0067: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages*, but it's primary purpose is to make you better at *thinking* about computer programs.

## Schedule

*See [detailed schedule](schedule.html) for a comprehensive day-by-day synopsis.*

The unit is divided into three parts, each of which is run by one of the three lecturers.

{: .pure-table-striped .pure-table}
| Period | Lecturer | Topic |
|:------:|:--------:|:------| 
| Weeks 1-4    | Steven Ramsay | Regular Expressions |
| Weeks 5,7,8  | François Dupressoir | While Language: Syntax and Semantics |
| Weeks 9-11   | Alex Kavvos | While Language: Expressive Power  |

<br/>

You should expect to spend around *12 hours per week* working on this unit.  There are 5 main activities (approximate time in parentheses, overall there is some slack):

  * __Lectures (2 hr).__ There are two in-person lectures each week, *Mondays at 1pm in Queens 1.40* and *Fridays at 2pm in Chemistry LT1*.  

  * __Labs (2 hr).__  Except in Week 1, labs run in-person every Monday from 4pm-6pm in MVB 1.15 and MVB 2.11.  Most of the time, you will need pen and paper to work on the problems, occasionally you will want to do some (Haskell) programming.  We have an excellent selection of teaching assistants on this unit, and their sole responsibility in each lab is to *help you*.  Some of the problems are not designed to be solved by a single person in a short amount of time, so you will need the help of the TAs and/or the help of your peers in order to solve them. 

  * __Problem sheets (2-6 hr).__ You will only learn on this unit by completing the problem sheets.  There is one sheet released each week.  You will spend time working on the sheets in labs, but you will likely need much longer to complete them fully in your own time.

  * __Office hours (<1 hr).__ Each week there will be office hours with the lecturer, either online or in their office in MVB.  These will be irregular and advertised separately in each week.

  * __Reading (2 hr).__  You will often benefit from alternative explanations of the same concepts, which would not fit into the time available for lectures.  You will need to spend time revising and rethinking topics before you can solve the associated problems.

*The most important activity is to give a serious attempt (at least 2 hours) to each problem sheet and get help when you are stuck. The easiest way to do this is to attend the weekly lab.  If you do not, you will likely fail this unit.*

## Navigating the course

The unit is distributed over four locations:

* This [blackboard page][bb], which contains:
    - the [welcome page](welcome.html), listing administrative information about the unit
    - the [detailed schedule](schedule.html), which gives brief lecture synopses, the problem sheets and their solutions

* The [reference book][rf]{: target="_blank" }, which contains a reference version of technical material introduced in the lectures: you will need to refer to this when completing the problems.  

* The [team][te]{: target="_blank" }, where you post your questions and we do our best to answer them.
